using maps to store parks to explore

# TBD
How to save parks?  
    Perhaps csv to save park name and location.  
    Give a csv field for a note about the park and/or a link to the website for the park.  
    Make a field for visted? (Date of visit as well)
    Make a website to render the map and also include a place to list new parks.
    Interact with mapbox through clicking to drop pins and get lat/lon?
    Make into a website with django?
